# Our Story
It was November 2009, in Rochester NY and the ACUI was hosting it's annual regional conference. Victoria and Shawn met at the conference and quickly became friends, and a year later would start dating. For two years Victoria and Shawn were more than three hours apart, yet every two weeks they would make the trip to meet each other. For six years Shawn and Victoria continued to date and grow closer together. Victoria and Shawn started to increase the size of their family by adopting their cat Tallulah and their dog Stella. It was on April 10th when Shawn proposed to Victoria at Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan. This location was chosen because of the symbolic nature for the start and end of the many adventures they have taken together.
